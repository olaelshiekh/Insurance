Smoking Detection Analysis

Overview
This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on smoking detection using insurance and health-related data. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and predictive factors that could be indicators of smoking habits in individuals. This analysis could aid in better understanding risk factors for insurers and healthcare providers.

Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Managing missing values, outliers, and data types for effective analysis.
Descriptive Statistics: Summary metrics to understand key trends and distributions.
Visual Analysis: Graphs and heatmaps to reveal correlations and highlight features relevant to smoking detection.
Predictive Insights: Analysis of key features that contribute to smoking behavior prediction.
