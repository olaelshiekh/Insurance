# Smoking Detection Analysis

![Smoking Detection Analysis](A_visual_representation_of_smoking_detection_analy.png)

## Overview

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on smoking detection using insurance and health-related data. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, and predictive factors that could be indicators of smoking habits in individuals. This analysis could aid in better understanding risk factors for insurers and healthcare providers.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Managing missing values, outliers, and data types for effective analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary metrics to understand key trends and distributions.
- **Visual Analysis**: Graphs and heatmaps to reveal correlations and highlight features relevant to smoking detection.
- **Predictive Insights**: Analysis of key features that contribute to smoking behavior prediction.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/smoking-detection-analysis.git
    cd smoking-detection-analysis
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Install them via:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open and run the notebook to execute the analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook W06_S29_EDA.ipynb
    ```

## Analysis Insights

The analysis focuses on exploring various factors such as age, BMI, and charges to identify patterns that may indicate smoking habits. Through visual and statistical techniques, this project highlights important correlations and outliers in smoking detection.

## Future Work

- **Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to predict smoking behavior.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Extended Datasets**: Include broader datasets to enhance model robustness.
